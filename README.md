# Setup Instructions
In order to run the GUI:
Go to the ports tab. Click "Add port" and type the number 6080.
Follow the link to your forwarded address. This is where your GUI should be available once you run your code. Note that the GUI won't work very well until you have finished most of the code - tests will be used to make sure the intermediate steps works well. 

To access the code, go to app > src > main > java


# Programming Instructions

1. Run the current program! Does it work? What happens if you write a bad input?
2. Read through the current code and comments. There are two new concepts to learn about - [JTextField](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/swing/swing_jtextfield.htm) for inputs and [try/catch statements](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_try_catch.asp). 
3. Add a new row that converts Celcius to Farenheight
4. Add a final row that convers units of your choosing, real or imagined. For reference, here is a list of [imperial units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units) - there are many, many, many.
5. Submit!

# Testing
Just run your code! Interact with the GUI you create and see if things behave as you expect. 

# Submission
 Submit on github classroom by running the following commands. This also saves your work permanently (unless you actively want to delete it). 

```
git add . 
git commit -m "submitting"
git push
```
